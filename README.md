# Public-Key-Infrastructure-

Public Key Infrastructure for Asymmetric Encryption implementation
> Definition:
  A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and workstations used
for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, in
-cluding the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

## End Entity (EE)	
The certificate holder (User or Device).	To prove who they are without giving away their private key.
## Registration Authority (RA)
Identity verification.	To make sure "Alice" isn't actually a malicious bot in a trench coat before she gets a cert.
## Certificate Authority (CA)
The "Root of Trust" that signs certificates.	Because a certificate is just a piece of paper unless someone important (the CA) signs it.
## Repository	
A public directory of certificates.	So Bob can find Alice's public key without having to call her on the phone.
CRL Issuer
